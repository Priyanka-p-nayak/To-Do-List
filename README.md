# To-Do List Website

A stylish and aesthetic To-Do List web application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## ðŸš€ How I Built This

I made this project as a way to practice:
- Modern **HTML5 structure**
- **CSS gradients and glassmorphism** design trends
- **JavaScript DOM manipulation**
- Local Storage to persist data
- GitHub Pages for free hosting

I used **vanilla JavaScript**â€”no frameworks or libraries.

## âœ¨ How to Use

1. Open the website in your browser.
2. Enter the task details:
   - Name
   - Start and End Dates
   - Time (with AM/PM selectors)
   - Priority
3. Click **Add Task**.
4. Filter tasks using the dropdown.
5. Click âœŽ to edit or Ã— to delete a task.

All your tasks will remain saved until you clear your browser storage.
